# My first `web Developement` repo.
**Here** I have first front-end practices,
such as introcuding a few **XHTML** labels like `<p>, <br/>, <a>, <img>` and a few of its attributes like `href` for links or `src` for images.

We have been practicing also with local links, wich are triggered using `<a href="#name">` to set the link source in our text, and then sending to line by the use of the attibute `< id="name">Link destination</>` .It is possible to use it with various labels (in destination). Could be a header as well as a paragraph, for example, if I am not wrong.

There are some interesting points wich are discovered through practice. That is, for example, some image attributes are required but not necessarily with a value on them.

 That is the case of `alt=""`, wich as we were told, eventually should contain picture description. It is also interesting that we can maintain picture proportions only changing one of its resolution values, instead of two. That means we should use `width=""` or `height=""`

 I am not including images on this repos, because I am interested in use these files as little reminders of what I have learn in each exercise.
